# Olimex KiCAD components and footprints

## Why are these components and footprints not pushed to the official KiCAD repository? 

These component and footprint libraries are not pushed to the official KiCAD repository as they are application-specific to our technology and assembly processes.
For this reason, they cannot be considered generic or modular enough for everyone's needs.

In most cases, these components and footprints duplicate the components and packages already residing in the standard KiCAD library.
We find these difficult to use, so we don't use them.

These component libraries are the ones we currently use when we design our products and just work fine for our processes.
We continually update these libraries each time we optimize our production processes for better yield, so you can be confident that they are not static.

## Why are there no 3D drawings available for the components?

Our developers are too busy (umhm... read lazy) to learn decent 3D CAD drawing skills and to add proper 3D CAD packages to these components.
As a matter of fact, we are very poor at mechanics as well and never found good use of these nice 3D objects with KiCAD and therefore never used them.
If anyone would like to contribute 3D drawings for these components, you are certainly welcome to do so! :)
